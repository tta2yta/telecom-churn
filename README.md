#challenge
Customer churn is a critical and challenging problem affecting business and industry,
in particularly, the rapidly growing, highly competitive telecommunication sector
because most customers have multiple options from which to choose within a
geographic location. There are 400 millions subscribers in the US telecommunication
industry. The availability of wireless devices and networks is everywhere. Everyone
has access to cell phones and internet. From social network to shopping or travelling,
people can retrieve their needs and enjoy their leisure time online. Everything is
accessible through mobile devices and Internet. Therefore, this is the prosperous
market to thrive in. Nevertheless, competitions also arises in this market. With similar
services, different companies compete vigorously for a segment in the telecom
industry. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more
customers loyalty. The core to succeed in this market lies in the customer itself.
